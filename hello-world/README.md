- Simple struct type with method
    Go lang don't have objects and classes so Struct are used to create types and you can add behaviour to them using pointers
- Array and Function types
    You can create types of any other type e.g struct or array or function as well and can attach method to them
- Interface usage
    Interfaces are used to achieve polymorphsim just like any other Object oriented language, but in go any type that compatible with interfaces behaviour can be used for that interface parameter
- Composition
    You can compose type with subtypes and so on.
